In C#, a variable is a symbolic name associated with a storage location in memory where data can be stored. Variables can hold different types of data such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, etc.

Declaring and Initializing Variables in C#
Declaration: To declare a variable, you specify the data type followed by the variable name. Declaration does not allocate a value to the variable; it only reserves a space in memory for it.

Initialization: You can also initialize a variable, meaning you assign it an initial value when you declare it. Initializing a variable allocates a value to the memory location reserved for that variable.


Example:

int age;  // Declaration
age = 25; // Initialization

// Or both at once:
int age = 25; // Declaration + Initialization
